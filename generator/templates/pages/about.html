        Neologinator is a generator of made-up words (i.e., pseudowords). Pseudowords are generated using
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_n-gram_language_model">n-gram markov models</a>, which 
        have been trained on a dataset of words represented as grapheme-phoneme alignments. That is, the words 
        are generated based on the probability of one grapheme-phoneme pair at a time, given the previous n grapheme-phoneme pairs. 
        For example, given an initial grapheme-phoneme pair of c_k, a bigram model (n = 2) will generate the next grapheme-phoneme pair based on the probability 
        of it occurring after c_k in the training dataset. 
        The words generated by the n-gram model are checked against a dictionary of English words, as well as a list of 
        English proper nouns, to ensure the generated word is not a real word. As these look-ups are not exhaustive, it is 
        possible that some real words may still be generated.
